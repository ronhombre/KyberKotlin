# KyberKotlin _implements ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber)_

[Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml) is an IND-CCA2-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), whose
security is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. Kyber is one 
of the finalists in the NIST post-quantum cryptography project. The submission lists three different parameter sets 
aiming at different security levels. Specifically, Kyber-512 aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-128, Kyber-768 
aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-192, and Kyber-1024 aims at security roughly equivalent to AES-256.

This project is semi-fully based on FIPS 203! (Some seemingly unintended changes were reverted i.e. transposition of
two matrices.)

## CAUTION

**_THIS PROJECT IS IN OPTIMIZATION PHASE. TESTED ON JAVA 17!_**

## Introduction

This is a 100% Kotlin Multiplatform implementation of ML-KEM.
It uses a Kotlin [hash](https://github.com/KotlinCrypto/hash) library in order to implement SHAKE and SHA3 within the library.

## Benchmarks (Tested on a Ryzen 7 5800X)

| Variant | Generation | Encapsulation | Decapsulation |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 512     | 12332      | 8683          | 5446.8        |
| 768     | 16027.6    | 12783.8       | 9783.2        |
| 1024    | 21640.4    | 18687.8       | 15753.2       |
| ML-KEM  | (in ms)    | (in ms)       | (in ms)       |

Ran with JVM 17 5 times and averaged. Lower is better.
Code is in [Benchmark.kt](https://github.com/ronhombre/KyberKotlin/blob/master/src/commonTest/kotlin/asia/hombre/kyber/Benchmark.kt)

This benchmark is for performance tracking through the development.

## Capabilities
* Encapsulation (512, 768, 1024)
* Decapsulation (512, 768, 1024)

NOTE: THIS VERSION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.

### Usage

```Kotlin
import asia.hombre.kyber.KeyAgreement
import asia.hombre.kyber.KyberKeyPairGenerator
import asia.hombre.kyber.KyberParameter

//Generate keys
//This would be done in their own systems
val keyPairAlice = KyberKeyPairGenerator().generate(KyberParameter.ML_KEM_512)
val keyPairBob = KyberKeyPairGenerator().generate(KyberParameter.ML_KEM_512)

val agreementAlice = KeyAgreement(keyPairAlice)

//Bob sends his encapsulation key to Alice
//Alice uses it to encapsulate a Secret Key
val cipherTextAlice = agreementAlice.encapsulate(keyPairBob.encapsulationKey)

val agreementBob = KeyAgreement(keyPairBob)

//Alice sends the Cipher Text to Bob
//Bob decapsulates the Cipher Text
val secretKeyBob = agreementBob.decapsulate(cipherTextAlice.cipherText)

//Alice generated the Secret Key
println("Gen: " + cipherTextAlice.secretKey.joinToString(", "))
//Bob decapsulated the same Secret Key
println("Rec: " + secretKeyBob.joinToString(", "))

//Bob's Secret Key
//[91, 119, -51, 71, -106, 30, -66, 47, 53, -7, -119, -38, -78, 61, -27, 44, -15, -47, -115, -92, -26, -120, 124, -17, -121, 83, 0, -57, -71, 118, 2, -31]
//Alice's Secret Key
//[91, 119, -51, 71, -106, 30, -66, 47, 53, -7, -119, -38, -78, 61, -27, 44, -15, -47, -115, -92, -26, -120, 124, -17, -121, 83, 0, -57, -71, 118, 2, -31]

//bobSecretKey == aliceSecretKey
```

In this example, **Bob** and **Alice** creates an **Agreement** that an eavesdropper would not be able to comprehend even
if it is intercepted. After generating the _Shared Secret Key_, they may communicate using a Symmetric Encryption
algorithm _i.e. AES_.

### Intent

The intentions of this project are pure and transparent. Its goal is to decouple from the JVM and become a self-sufficient
Kotlin Multiplatform dependency. In other words, a PURE Kotlin implementation of ML-KEM in a lightweight format. This is
a stark difference compared to Bouncy Castle that supports most Encryption Algorithms and has a large data footprint.

At the 1.0.0 release, developers should be able to use this dependency if they want to support ML-KEM.

### Goal

To align with the NIST ML-KEM specification which is the designated Algorithm name for CRYSTALS-Kyber.
_**Digital security for all, everywhere, no matter who they are, or what they believe in.**_

### TODO List

* More unit tests (Please help).
* Optimize method names, attribute names, etc.
* Clean up code.
* Optimize code for Kotlin.
* Add references to FIPS 203.
* Add classes for jvmMain.

### Why did I create this? _From Ron (Project Creator)_

I tried [kyberJCE](https://github.com/fisherstevenk/kyberJCE), the implementation of Steven Fisher. However, I encountered 
many bugs and problems whilst trying to make it work. I found his library to be nice, but it was full of inefficiencies
that I thought I could fix. So far, I have made KyberKotlin simple in its use. In the future, I want to use this library
as a dependency for my future applications.
